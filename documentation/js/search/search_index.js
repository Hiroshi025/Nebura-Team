user entity, and triggers OAuth2 validation in the AuthService.\nExample :// Usage in a NestJS module\nimport { DiscordStrategy } from './discord.strategy';\n  providers: [DiscordStrategy],\n})\nexport class AuthModule {}See NestJS Authentication\nSee passport-discord\n\n            \n\n            \n                Extends\n            \n            \n

code.\n\n📝 Table of Contents\n\nHow to Contribute\nDevelopment Workflow\nCode Style Guide\nCommit Message Guidelines\nPull Request Process\nTesting\nDocumentation\nReporting Issues\nCommunity & Help\nResources\n\n\nHow to Contribute\n\nFork the repository.\nClone your fork:Example :git clone https://github.com//Nebura-AI.git\ncd Nebura-AI\nCreate a branch for your feature or fix:Example :git checkout -b feat/my-feature\nMake your changes (see Code Style Guide).\nTest your changes (see Testing).\nCommit with a descriptive message (see Commit Message Guidelines).\nPush to your fork:Example :git push origin feat/my-feature\nOpen a Pull Request on GitHub.\n\n\nDevelopment Workflow\n\nAll development happens on feature branches (feat/, fix/, docs/, etc.).\nThe main branch is protected and only maintainers can merge.\nPull Requests are reviewed and must pass CI before merging.\n\nExample: Adding a New API Endpoint\n\nCreate a controller in src/interfaces/http/routes/your-feature/controllers/.\nAdd service logic in src/interfaces/http/routes/your-feature/service/.\nRegister your module in src/app.module.ts.\nAdd tests in test/ or alongside your feature.\nDocument your endpoint in Swagger decorators.\n\n\nCode Style Guide\n\nLanguage: TypeScript (strict mode)\nFormatting: Prettier\nLinting: ESLint\nNaming: Use camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes/types, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants.\nImports: Use absolute imports with path aliases (e.g., #entity/users/user.entity).\nComments: Use JSDoc for public classes and methods.\n\nExample\nExample :/**\n * Returns a greeting for the given user.\n * @param name The user's name.\n */\nexport function greet(name: string): string {\n  return `Hello, ${name}!`;\n}Run formatting and linting before committing:\nExample :npm run format\nnpm run lint\nCommit Message Guidelines\n\nUse Conventional Commits:\nfeat: for new features\nfix: for bug fixes\ndocs: for documentation\nrefactor: for code refactoring\ntest: for tests\nchore: for build or tooling changes\n\n\n\nExample\nExample :feat(auth): add JWT refresh token endpoint\n\nfix(users): correct email validation regex\n\ndocs(readme): update installation instructions\nPull Request Process\n\nEnsure your branch is up to date with main.\nAll checks (CI, tests, lint) must pass.\nProvide a clear description of your changes.\nReference related issues (e.g., Closes #42).\nAdd screenshots or code snippets if relevant.\n\n\nTesting\n\nUnit tests: Place in src/**/__tests__ or *.spec.ts.\nE2E tests: Place in test/ or _test_/.\nUse Jest for all tests.\n\nRunning Tests\nExample :npm run test         # Unit tests\nnpm run test:e2e     # End-to-end tests\nnpm run test:cov     # Coverage reportExample Test\nExample :import { greet } from \"./greet\";\n\ndescribe(\"greet\", () => {\n  it(\"should greet the user by name\", () => {\n    expect(greet(\"Nebura\")).toBe(\"Hello, Nebura!\");\n  });\n});\nDocumentation\n\nUse Swagger decorators for API docs.\nUpdate the README.md and add usage examples if you change public APIs.\nFor complex features, add markdown docs in a /docs folder.\n\n\nReporting Issues\n\nUse GitHub Issues.\nInclude steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and screenshots/logs if possible.\nFor security issues, please email alchemistdevs@gmail.com instead of opening a public issue.\n\n\nCommunity & Help\n\nHelp Center: https://help.hiroshi-dev.me/\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/G7Qnnhy\nDiscussions: Use GitHub Discussions for questions and ideas.\n\n\nResources\n\nNestJS Docs\nTypeORM Docs\nDiscord.js Docs\nWhatsApp Web.js Docs\nSwagger/OpenAPI\nJest Testing\nPrettier\nESLint\n\n\n\n  Thank you for making Nebura Control better!
